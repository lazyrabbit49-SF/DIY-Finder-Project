message: |
  Empty except block detected. This makes debugging difficult and hides errors.
  Always handle or log exceptions appropriately.

note: |
  Silent error suppression makes it impossible to diagnose issues in production.
  
  Example fix:
  ```python
  # Bad
  try:
      process_data()
  except:
      pass
  
  # Good
  try:
      process_data()
  except Exception as e:
      logger.error(f"Failed to process data: {e}")
      raise
  ```

rule:
  any:
    - pattern: |
        try:
            $$$
        except:
            pass
    - pattern: |
        try:
            $$$
        except Exception:
            pass
